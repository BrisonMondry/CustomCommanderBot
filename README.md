## Intended Features
here is a list of the features that we will inevitably fail to fully implement, in order of priority
- The bot will create a post that will use reactions from users to identify
  those who inted to play in a round of custom commander, and those who are done building :red_circle:
  - when everyone that has indicated they are participating in a round has indicated they are
    done building, the bot should message everyone involed to let them know. :red_circle:
  - The bot should be able to ping everyone who has indicated they want to participate but have
    not yet indicated they are done building :red_circle:
- The bot should be able to keep track of commanders and their versions :red_circle:
  - bot should the bot should be able to search commanders by name, color identity, and creator
    and return only the most up-to-date version of a commander :red_circle:
  - the bot should be able to show a list of all revisions of a commander :red_circle:
- The bot should be able to be configured :red_circle:
  - You should be able to correct a creator, assign / change / update color identity, etc for a 
    commander :red_circle:
